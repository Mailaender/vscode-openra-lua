# OpenRA Visual Studio Code Lua extension

This is an IDE companion for the [OpenRA Lua API](https://docs.openra.net/en/latest/release/lua/) which is used to write mission scripts in [OpenRA](https://www.openra.net), an Open Source real-time strategy game engine for early Westwood games such as Command & Conquer: Red Alert. This extension uses [Sumneko's](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua) Lua [Language Server](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) with [EmmyLua annotations](https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server/wiki/EmmyLua-Annotations).
